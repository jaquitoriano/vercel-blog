## Database Migration

The project has been migrated from SQLite to Vercel Postgres. The migration process involved:

1. Updating the Prisma schema to use PostgreSQL as the provider
2. Creating a baseline migration for the existing database schema
3. Updating environment variables to use Vercel Postgres connection strings
4. Creating and running a seed script to populate the database with sample data
